Where Does My Money Go?
=======================

Where Does My Money Go? aims to promote transparency and citizen engagement through 
the analysis and visualisation of information about UK public spending. The site was
launched in 2009 and merged with OffenerHaushalt in 2010 to form the OpenSpending 
project. 


What is in this repository?
---------------------------

Where Does My Money Go runs as an application on top of OpenSpending. All data is
stored in the platform and the visualizations and search are driven directly from
its API. As well as providing the source code for the WDMMG live site, this code
base is also intended as an example on which other OpenSpending apps can be
derived.


How do I make a budget site for my own country/region?
------------------------------------------------------

If you want to set up a budget monitoring site for your own country, you first need
to acquire some budgetary or spending data and load it into OpenSpending using the 
site's web interface. Once the data is loaded, you can fork this repository and 
change the titles, styles and arrangement to meet your individual needs. Finally,
you can either host the site yourself, or let GitHub Pages do it.
